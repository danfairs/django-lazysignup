0.4.x
-----

This version fixes a number of issues, adds new features and has backwards-
incompatible changes:

  - Fix a RST issue in README
  - Fix an issue where a POST to the convert view would break if the user was anonymous.
    The convert view now redirects to the LOGIN_URL by default, parameterised in the view.
    
New features:

  - It is now easier to customise the process of converting a lazy user into a real user.
    Previous versions allowed a custom form to be passed to the `convert` view, but the
    code always expected a `username` and `password1` field to get credentials from to 
    log the user in. Now, a new `get_credentials()` method is called on the form to obtain
    these credentials.
  - The tests module now includes a ``no_lazysignup`` decorator that you can apply to a 
    method on your test case, which removes the lazy signup middleware for the duration
    of that test only. This is useful for testing what happens when a view that is 
    marked with with the ``allow_lazy_user`` decorator ends up with an anonymous user
    (most commonly, when a search engine visits).

Backwards-incompatible changes:

  - Generated usernames are now based on the session key, rather than actually being the
    session key. This is to avoid a potential security issue where an app might simply
    display a username, giving away a significant part of the user's session key. The 
    username is now generated from a SHA1 hash of the session key. This change means that
    existing generated users will become invalid.

0.3.0
-----

This version introduces a backwards-incompatible changes, renaming the ``@allow_lazy``
decorator to ``@allow_lazy_user``. This is to avoid confusion with the decorator of
the same name in ``django.utils.functional``.

0.2.0
-----

This version fixes a number of issues:

  - Correct a duplicated test
  - Fix a bug where a new user would not be created if they already had a
    session key.
    
It also introduces a new feature, user agent blacklisting. This aims to
prevent explosive growth in the number of users created by search engines,
etc. This feature is still in test, so patches and feedback welcome. Note that
this introduces a backwards-incompatibly behaviour. Prior to this release,
it was safe to assume that all views marked with the ``@allow_lazy`` decorator
would receive an authenticated user. This is now no longer the case.

See the README.rst file for more information.

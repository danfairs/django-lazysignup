0.2.0
-----

This version fixes a number of issues:

  - Correct a duplicated test
  - Fix a bug where a new user would not be created if they already had a
    session key.
    
It also introduces a new feature, user agent blacklisting. This aims to
prevent explosive growth in the number of users created by search engines,
etc. This feature is still in test, so patches and feedback welcome. Note that
this introduces a backwards-incompatibly behaviour. Prior to this release,
it was safe to assume that all views marked with the ``@allow_lazy`` decorator
would receive an authenticated. This is now no longer the case.

See the README.rst file for more information.

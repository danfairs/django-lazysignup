1.0.2
-----

* Add `csrf_token` to convert form (thanks jnoss)
* Fix dependency on incorrect version of `six` (#47)
* Minor tidy of the way databases are selected in tests

1.0.1
-----
* Fix packaging issue

1.0.0
-----
* Add support for Django 1.7 migrations
* Drop support for Django 1.6 and earlier
* Add tests for custom user model
* Migrated lazy_user's user to a OneToOneField() from a ForeignKey(unique=True)

0.12.2
------

Fix another packaging error. Thanks to David Eyk (eykd) for the pull request.

0.12.1
------

Fix a packaging error. Thanks to Tamas Mako (tomako) for reporting it.

0.12.0
------

Add compatibility with Django 1.5 and Python 3.3. Note that this does not yet
explicitly support Django 1.5's new pluggable User models in any particular
way.

Thanks to Brad Pitcher for this work.

0.11.1
------

Fix packaging and docs errors.

0.11.0
------

This is a feature release, that requires a data migration. Use the
provided South migration, or add a `created` date/time field to your `LazyUser`
model manually. This field will be populated when a `LazyUser` instance is
created, and is set to the current date/time.

A `test-requirements.txt` file has been added to ease installation of test-only
dependencies.

A new-style DATABASES structure replaces the old DATABASE_* fields.

Versions of Django earlier than 1.4 are no longer supported. Nothing has been
done to explicitly prevent 1.3.x working, but it will no longer be maintained.
(Patches to restore support, if it breaks, are welcome.)

0.10.3
------

Fix packaging error.

0.10.2
------

This is a docs-only release. Docs have converted to Sphinx, for easier
navigation.

0.10.1
------

This is a bugfix release, which included some docs omitted from the 0.10.0
release.

0.10.0
------

This is a feature release. Two new decorators have been added:
`@require_lazy_user` and `@require_nonlazy_user`.

Thanks to Brad Beattie (bradbeattie) for the implementation and tests, and to
Adam Coddington (latestrevision) for the original suggestion.


0.9.0
-----

This is a feature release. A custom signal is now fired when a user is
converted. Thanks to Olly Smith (oesmith) for the patch.

Versions of Django earlier than 1.3 are now no longer supported. (Nothing has
been done to prevent 1.2.x working, but I will no longer take care to make sure
that this remains the case.)


0.8.0
-----

This is a feature release. This contains all the features in the 0.8.0 beta
series, plus the ability to specify custom templates for the convert view,
both via a regular GET and via Ajax. Thanks to percyperez for the idea and
initial implementation.

Note that this release is the last feature release that will support Django
1.2 or earlier. 0.9.0 and later will require Django 1.3 or later.


0.8.0b2
-------

This release introduces the following backwards-incompatible changes:

* A test project was added to make running the tests a little easier. The old
  way of running the tests has been removed.
* The `urls.py` no longer hardcodes `convert` as the URL prefix (thanks
  to mitar)

0.8.0b1
-------

This is a bugfix and feature release. The internal API has changed to no
longer depend on session keys for username generation. This should be
backwards-compatible as long as you are using the documented API.

The following bugs have been fixed:

* PEP8 cleanups
* Tweak setup.py to make sure templates are installed (thanks Kurt Grandis)

The following features have been added:

* Removed the hard dependency on session keys to generate usernames, as it was
  unnecessary.
* remove_expired_users should no longer depend on using the database session
  backend - it will instead use SESSION_COOKIE_AGE to find lazy users
  who have not logged in recently and whose sessions will therefore have
  expired.

You should still not use remove_expired_users without reviewing the code;
in particular, you may wish to subclass the command and override
`to_delete()`.

These changes are somewhat experimental, so this is a beta release - it is
*not* recommended that you run this in production. Testing and feedback is
welcome.

0.7.0
-----

This is a feature release. Custom user classes are now supported via the
``LAZYSIGNUP_USER_MODEL`` setting. This is a backwards-compatible change.

Thanks to Luke Zapart for the idea and initial implementation.

0.6.2
-----

This is a bugfix release. Issues fixed:

* The LazySignupBackend no longer relies on a specific User class to
  authenticate a user. It now uses the fact that there is a relationship
  between the LazyUser and the main site User class. This fixes the bug
  where authenticate() was looking directly for UNUSABLE_PASSWORD, and also
  paves the way for custom user classes.

0.6.1
-----

This is a bugfix release. Issues fixed:

* https://github.com/danfairs/django-lazysignup/issues#issue/2 - Invalid user
  IDs in the session could cause an AttributeError from the auth backend.

Thanks to Alex Ehlke for the report and patch.

0.6.0
-----

This is a feature release:

* Users created lazily but not currently logged-in are now correctly detected
  as lazy users. To facilitate this, a ``LazyUser`` model is included. Note
  that existing code using ``is_lazy_user`` only on authenticated users will
  continue to work, as the old method of checking the ``backend`` attribute
  of the ``User`` object has been retained - it's faster to do that than a
  potentially unnecessary database query.

  For those who use it, a South migration is provided to create the initial
  table. Data migration will be handled by South migrations from now on.

* The canonical import location of ``is_lazy_user`` has changed from within
  ``lazysignup.templatetags.lazysignup_tags`` to ``lazysignup.utils``.
  Existing code that imports from the old location will continue to work.

0.5.1
-----

Bugfix release:

- Fix an issue where a lazy user would be misidentified as a non-lazy user

0.5.0
-----

This version simplifies the implementation significantly by removing the requirement for
a middleware. This is a backwards-incompatible change as the ``lazysignup.middleware``
module no longer exists, and needs to be removed from your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` list.

This change means that you can no longer disable the software by removing the middleware
class from your configuration. You might want to do this temporarily in development, for
example, when testing that your views still work when an anonymous user is presented to
them (perhaps through the user agent blacklisting functionality).

To this end, support for a new settings has been added: ``ENABLE_LAZYSIGNUP``. It's set
to True by default. Setting it to False will both prevent automatic login and
automatic user creation.

The ``allow_lazy_user`` decorator no longer has to be first in the decorator list. Thanks
to Jauco Noordzij for pointing this out initially.

There is now also an ``is_lazy_user`` template filter, which will return True if the
current user is an automatically created user. It will return False for users who are
anonymous, or were authenticated by some other means. Thanks again to Jauco Noordzij
for the idea for this feature.

Note that the ``is_lazy_user`` filter (which you can also just import and use
directly in your view code) is the preferred way of checking for an automatically
created user. ``has_usable_password`` will continue to return False for such users,
but is no longer the canonical way to identify them. Users authenticated with
other authentication backends (for example, LDAP backends) may return False when
``has_usable_password`` is called.


0.4.0
-----

This version fixes a number of issues, adds new features and has backwards-
incompatible changes:

  - Fix a RST issue in README
  - Fix an issue where a POST to the convert view would break if the user was anonymous.
    The convert view now redirects to the LOGIN_URL by default, parameterised in the view.

New features:

  - It is now easier to customise the process of converting a lazy user into a real user.
    Previous versions allowed a custom form to be passed to the ``convert`` view, but the
    code always expected a ``username`` and ``password1`` field to get credentials from to
    log the user in. Now, a new ``get_credentials()`` method is called on the form to obtain
    these credentials.
  - The tests module now includes a ``no_lazysignup`` decorator that you can apply to a
    method on your test case, which removes the lazy signup middleware for the duration
    of that test only. This is useful for testing what happens when a view that is
    marked with with the ``allow_lazy_user`` decorator ends up with an anonymous user
    (most commonly, when a search engine visits).

Backwards-incompatible changes:

  - Generated usernames are now based on the session key, rather than actually being the
    session key. This is to avoid a potential security issue where an app might simply
    display a username, giving away a significant part of the user's session key. The
    username is now generated from a SHA1 hash of the session key. This change means that
    existing generated users will become invalid.

0.3.0
-----

This version introduces a backwards-incompatible changes, renaming the ``@allow_lazy``
decorator to ``@allow_lazy_user``. This is to avoid confusion with the decorator of
the same name in ``django.utils.functional``.

0.2.0
-----

This version fixes a number of issues:

  - Correct a duplicated test
  - Fix a bug where a new user would not be created if they already had a
    session key.

It also introduces a new feature, user agent blacklisting. This aims to
prevent explosive growth in the number of users created by search engines,
etc. This feature is still in test, so patches and feedback welcome. Note that
this introduces a backwards-incompatibly behaviour. Prior to this release,
it was safe to assume that all views marked with the ``@allow_lazy`` decorator
would receive an authenticated user. This is now no longer the case.

See the README.rst file for more information.
